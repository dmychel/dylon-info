          I began my Web Development back in 2022. These past couple of years
          have been a wild ride, not exactly smooth sailing, but I wouldn&apos;t
          change a thing. Teaching myself to code has been a rollercoaster of
          highs and lows, but it&apos;s given me the confidence to tackle and
          learn anything I need to. There were moments when I felt totally
          demoralized, but look at this website right nowâ€”I built it from
          scratch. You get internal value form creating something from nothing.
